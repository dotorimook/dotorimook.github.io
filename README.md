## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is configured to deploy to **GitHub Pages**.

### 1. Automatic Deployment (GitHub Actions) - Recommended
A workflow is set up in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. 
1. Push your changes to `master` or `feature/astro-migration` branch.
2. Go to your GitHub Repository **Settings > Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment > Source**, select **GitHub Actions**.
4. The site will automatically build and deploy on every push.

### 2. Manual Deployment (CLI)
If you prefer to deploy manually from your local machine:
```sh
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
This will push the contents of the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

### ⚙️ Configuration
- **Site URL**: Configured in `astro.config.mjs` as `https://dotorimook.github.io`.
- **Package**: Uses `gh-pages` for manual deployment.
